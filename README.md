# Titanic-Survival-Exploration
In this project, we will explore a subset of the RMS Titanic passenger manifest to determine which features best predict whether someone survived or did not survive. Decision Tree algorithm is used for the predictions. To futher improve the accuracy we have used Grid Search with our Decision Tree algorithm.
